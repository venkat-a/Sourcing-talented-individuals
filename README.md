# Sourcing-talented-individuals
Developing a machine learning powered pipeline that could spot talented individuals, and rank them based on their fitness.â€¨
Based on the initial analysis of the provided Jupyter Notebook, here's a draft for a detailed technical README file:

## Libraries and Dependencies

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, enabling straightforward data cleaning and preparation.
- **Matplotlib.pyplot** and **Seaborn**: Utilized for data plotting and visualization in various formats. Seaborn, in particular, provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics based on matplotlib.
- **WordCloud**: For creating word cloud images, which are visual representations of text data where the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.
- **Transformers**: Offers easy access to pre-trained models and tokenizers for natural language processing tasks, facilitating tasks such as text classification, tokenization, and embedding generation.
- **Torch (PyTorch)**: A library for building and training neural networks, indicating some form of machine learning or deep learning tasks.
- **Cosine_similarity (from sklearn.metrics.pairwise)**: Computes similarity between vectors, likely used to analyze text data or embeddings generated from the NLP models.
- **openpyxl**: A Python library to read/write Excel 2010 xlsx/xlsm/xltx/xltm files.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing


- Converting the 'connection' column into a numeric format, handling special cases like '500+' and dealing with missing values by assuming '0' connections. This step is essential for making the 'connection' data analyzable and comparable.

## Visualizations


- Creating a histogram for the `connection_numeric` column to analyze the distribution of connections among potential talents. This is achieved using seaborn's `histplot` function with specified bins and color settings.

## Analysis and Machine Learning

While the initial cells do not directly demonstrate machine learning tasks, the inclusion of libraries such as PyTorch and Transformers suggests that the notebook may involve:

- Training or applying pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks.
- Analyzing text data or embeddings generated from the NLP models, possibly using cosine similarity for comparisons.

## Conclusion

The work done: data analysis, combining techniques from data preprocessing and visualization to advanced natural language processing.
